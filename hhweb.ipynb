    "A network graph of rap artists' associations by shared phrases. These shared phrases could come about as a result of paying homage, intertextual allusion, or simple plagiarism.  Outside the realm of modern intellectual property, this is a common an well accepted practice in blues music, a genre where rap music has deep roots. \n",

    "This project will show directionality of borrowed phrases, inferred by release date, and cluster artist around influential artists with the most sampled/borrowed phrases.\n",

    "The length of a phrase will be proportional to number of times it appear in order for it to be significant.  This means that a short phrase must be highly unique to count as a link (to ensure it is not simply a common part of speech), while longer phrases can be shared, as their probability of _not_ being attributable is much less."
